This directory contains a tiny subset of the fascinating (but not yet very
modular) PySynth project by Martin C. Doege: https://github.com/mdoege/PySynth

Ideally, we could install PySynth with pip. When this is possible, we can remove
this directory. See https://github.com/mdoege/PySynth/issues/16 .
