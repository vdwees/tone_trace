Tone_Trace
==========

A command line utility to play your python file like a piano.

Motivations for writing this library are:

- Gain a more intuitive and out-of-the-box understanding of how my code is
  executed,
- Emphasize the connection between music and code, while learning about their
  differences,
- Create a fun toy that can make my day-job more interesting.
